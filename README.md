# Hello World, I'm Dagmawi Abera, but you can call me **Dag** 👋  
**Computer Engineer | Dreamer | Storyteller**

## 🌟 About Me
- 🎓 **Computer Engineering Graduate** – Minnesota State University, Mankato (May 2025)  
- 💼 **Actively seeking full-time roles** in **automation, embedded systems, and software development**  
- 🎥 Creator & storyteller, working on a **portfolio website and film projects**

  ### Why My GitHub Is Growing Now
During college, I focused on **coursework, internships, and hands-on projects**, many of which were done in **collaborative or company environments** using private repositories or on-site tools. 
 
Instead of uploading incomplete or messy class files, I chose to **wait until I could curate my best work**.  
Now that I’m transitioning into the job market, I’m **organizing, polishing, and presenting my projects** so my GitHub serves as a **professional portfolio for employers**, not just a class archive.
